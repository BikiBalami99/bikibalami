# Biki Balami - Portfolio

## Development Highlights

The website was built using modern front-end technologies, with React at its core:

-   **React** for building a dynamic, component-based UI
-   **CSS** for animation and stuling
-   **Responsive Design** ensuring optimal viewing across all devices
